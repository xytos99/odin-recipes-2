    <li>2 teaspoons garam masala, divided</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    <li>1 cup tomato puree</li>
    <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
    <li>¼ cup plain yogurt</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

    <li>¼ cup water</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. 
      Sauté shallot and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon 
      garam masala, chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 
      1 minute. Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to 
      frequently stir.</li>
    <li>Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 
      for 10 minutes, frequently stirring. Season with salt and pepper. 
      Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over 
      medium heat. Cook chicken until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala 
      and cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid 
      has reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked chicken into sauce 
      and stir together.</li>
    <li>Dissolve cornstarch into water, then mix into the sauce. 
      Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened.</li>
    <li>Serve over rice with naan.</li>
