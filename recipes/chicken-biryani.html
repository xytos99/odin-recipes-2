    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's 
      typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, 
      or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the 
      work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal 
      variety to use.
